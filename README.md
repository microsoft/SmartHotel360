SmartHotel360 is a fictitious smart hospitality company showcasing the future of connected travel. 

Their vision is to provide:
- Intelligent, conversational, and personalized apps and experiences to guests 
- Modern workplace experiences and smart conference rooms for business travelers
- Real-time customer and business insights for hotel managers & investors

There’s never been a better time to be a developer. Our intent with these set of reference apps is to show developers how to get started with Azure and build the apps of the future, today!
